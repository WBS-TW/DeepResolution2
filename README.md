# DeepResolution2
Deep learning-assisted multivariate curve Resolution 2

----------
Deep-Learning-Based Multivariate Curve Resolution 2 (DeepResolution2) was proposed for automatic resolution of GC-MS data. It utilized deep neural networks to divide the profile into segments, estimate the number of components in each segment, predict the elution region of each component in overlapped peaks, and resolve the overlapped peaks.

[TensorFlow (version 2.0.0-GPU)](https://github.com/tensorflow) 

dependent packages:
The packages mainly include: numpy,Scipy,Matplotlib,pandas and os.

These packages are included in the integration tool [Anaconda.](https://www.anaconda.com/) 

# Clone the repository and run it directly
[git clone](https://github.com/xiaqiong/DeepResolution) 

# Download the model and run directly

Since the model exceeded the limit, we have uploaded all the models and some GC-MS data to the Baidu SkyDrive and google drive.
