# DeepResolution2.0
Deep-Learning-Based Multivariate Curve Resolution 2.0 

----------
Deep-Learning-Based Multivariate Curve Resolution 2.0 (DeepResolution2.0) method has been proposed for automatic resolution of GC-MS data. It has excellent performance in resolving overlapped peaks and is suitable for large-scale data analysis. Compared with the classical multi-curve resolution method, it has the characteristics of fast, accurate and fully automatic.



# Installation

# Clone the repository and run it directly
[git clone](https://github.com/xiaqiong/DeepResolution) 

# Download the model and run directly

Since the model exceeded the limit, we have uploaded all the models and some GC-MS data to the Baidu SkyDrive and google drive.
